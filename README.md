# WeGlide Translation

The ``*.json`` files include the translation for different languages.
``en.json`` is up to date and includes all the keys used in WeGlide.
If a key is missing in another language, english will be used.


## Contribute

**Every help is greatly appreciated.**

You are invited to add your favorite language as new column to each key.

Please create your own branch named ``language/english`` (replace english with your language name) and submit a pull request when you are done.

*If you need help, are not familiar with git, do not want to use it or have other questions feel free to write us at info@weglide.org.*

Thank you!
